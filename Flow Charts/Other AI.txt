Standard gun and Double gun enemies will follow the main AI tree, machine gunners will have a similar tree but will not run away from the player, only moving to close any largish gap created, and snipers will use a varient of the standard tree that is long ranged and cares about exact position relative to sigma or the player less. Shotgunners will obviously follow their own tree, as will any other charged-shot enemies that come in the future.
